# Synthetic Betrayal Prediction Dataset and ML Model

Our <u>First Step</u> would be to **Generate a synthetic dataset** contains all the **parameter** we proposed in the [PDF](https://github.com/Namangoel1904/Being-Notified/blob/f7d39834b9540c392cb4b8926aa29353a806b97e/Innov8%202.0/Part%202.pdf) considering the theme of the problem statement which is to "Predict the Troop Betrayal in the War against the Phrygians".

To Generate such database and to convert it into *Dataframe* we can use python Library `Pandas`, `numpy` and it's functions `np.random.randint`, `np.random.uniform`, `np.random.binomial` for random integers, random floating-point numbers, and for binary events respectively.
Defining number of samples(n) to generate is a minor but importanat step.
Which in our case is set to 1000, `n_samples = 1000` setting up a fine number of samples is important which would be visible at the time of model training.

The Following code snippet shows **how we can generate the data** for column "wealth_score" by using numpy and .random function, defining the suitable range:
`wealth_score = np.random.randint(3, 11, n_samples)`

As **we don't have any real time dataset**, it's crucial to generate a dateset with our targeted column `Betrayal` with proper measurments.
Hence **Probability Distribution** for the patarameter defined played a crucial role here.
We can **generate a more realistic dataset** by assigning **Weightage for every parameter** proposed while probabilty distribution as done in our case
For Example: `prob_betrayal += (wealth_score <= 3) * 0.1` the snippet code shows here is the part of actual code and we are defining the probabilty distribution for the "Wealth_score" column or parameter here to be 0.1 of the total and the condidtion setted is that the value of the column should be "<= 3"

In the similar manner we can define the probability distributions for other paramenters and set their weightage accordingly to generate a dataset **closer to actual picture**
*Hit and Trial with fine tweeks is the key for the best sybthetic Dataset*

Now once we are satisfied with the [Synthetic_Betrayal_Data](https://github.com/Namangoel1904/Being-Notified/blob/main/Innov8%202.0/synthetic_betrayal_data.csv) we can move to
## **Preprocessing** of the data and **Model Building**
Since there are **no missing values** in our dataset we **don't need to use any encoding methos** to fill those gaps.
Out **dataset contains numerical values only** and so label encoding or count vectorization methods are also not required.
Though we must **Standardize the numericals features as they are on different scale** and for that we can use `scaler = StandardScaler()` on our train dataset.
and hence we first need to `import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection` to split the dataset into Test and train data so that we can run our model building.

Now comes the final and *repetitive* part `Model building`

for the model building we are using the following functions or Models from `sklearn` library to train our dataset:
`from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression`
`from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier`
`from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix`
`from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV`

As mentioned in the heading model building is a repetitive task i.e. we are using `logistic regressor`, `GradientBoosting`, and `RandomForestClassifier` to the out the accuracy across different model and finaize the best one.

Tunnning Selected Models need the understanding of the parameters involved in that respective model and so the integration of techinques like `Hyperparameter tuning`, `GridSearchCV`, `Confusion matrix`, plays an important step to achieve the maxium out of a model training.

**Further we can use Stacking Classifier to combine multiple base models for improved predictive performance.**
To increase the efficiency of data we can monitor and update the datset from real life and to handle the scalibilty we can use methods like:
`apply stratified sampling`
`Batch processing`
`Use models that support incremental learning`
`Dimensionality Reduction`

*Our Code conatins a quick trough of the process but may not consist use of all the techiniques mentioned above*
